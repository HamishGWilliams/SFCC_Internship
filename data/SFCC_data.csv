1630,Invasive non-native plants,"Invasive non-native plants such as Japanese knotweed, skunk cabbage, and rhododendron ponticum are present in significant numbers along many rivers within the Eachaig catchment.  Japanese knotweed is known for its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native plant species. It can quickly establish dense stands along riverbanks, which can increase the risk of flooding and bank erosion. This plant also creates a monoculture, which can reduce biodiversity and harm wildlife that depend on native plants for food and habitat. Skunk cabbage is another invasive species that can have negative impacts on river ecosystems. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate wetland conditions and can grow in areas that would normally be unsuitable for other plants. When skunk cabbage establishes along riverbanks, it can displace native plant species and reduce the diversity of plant life in the area. Rhododendron ponticum is an invasive shrub that is often found in riparian areas. This plant can create dense thickets along riverbanks, which can impede water flow and increase the risk of flooding. Rhododendron ponticum also produces toxins that can inhibit the growth of other plants, reducing biodiversity and creating a monoculture.

At a time when salmon recruitment is low, minimising the effect of piscivorous birds whose populations are healthy and/or increasing is important for ensuring the continuation of salmon stocks. Salmon produce more than enough eggs to populate a section of a river as large numbers are expected to not survive to migrate to sea - this is called density dependent selection when an over abundance of young accounts for a high level of mortality. Migrating salmon smolts are much reduced in their density and selection is now independent of their number.

2093,Protect water quantity,"The climate is changing in such a way that low flows are becoming increasingly frequent - partially because of dryer springs and summer combined with warmer and wetter winters reducing the amount of snow cover that historically would have melted in the spring. Low flows are problematic as they do not provide the environmental cues fish require the migrate out of the river or move upstream as adults. It also acts to concentrate the fish in smaller areas which increases competition for food, space and resources and makes fish more susceptible to predation.

2096,Invasive non-tive species,"Invasive non-tive species (INNS) can have multiple direct or indirect impacts. American mink will prey on salmon as well as other bankside and aquatic animals affecting local biodiversity. Bankside Invasive plants such as giant hogweed, Japanese knoweed, Himalayan balsam, and American skunk cabbage can domite an area and outcompete other species making access difficult and reducing biodiversity and habitat for tive species and important pollitors. Furthermore, these plants can reduce the stability of riverbanks as their root structures are not as tangled and extensive as a tural spread of tive plants. This can lead to bank collapse, loss of fish habitat, and increased sedimentation. In-river invasive plants - particularly Ranunculus - trap sediments which can lead to smothering of redd sites or freshwater pearl mussels. Large mats of Ranunculus hinders angling and makes responsible landing of fish difficult where present. There is evidence that Ranunculus provides shelter for juvenile salmon, especially in the chalk streams of southern England although Scottish rivers should have adequate substrate and habitat complexity for juvenile fish without the need for Ranunculus.",Invasive Non-native Species,,Ongoing,Medium,"Control the spread of INNS, particularly in riparian areas.",O,"The Trust will continue to coordite a volunteer monitoring and trapping programme for American mink.

The holistic approach to restoring Glen Geldie, on the western side of the estate, will see over 120 hectares planted with more than 100,000 tive Scots tree species along the banks of the River Geldie. Through time, the increase in vegetation will help slow the flow of water through the river system, alleviating flood risk downstream, while helping to prevent soil erosion and further loss of deep peat on the river’s banks. The planting along the banks of the river, a key spawning tributary for the River Dee’s iconic wild salmon, will benefit the river’s biodiverse ecosystem by providing vital cooling shade and leaf litter to enrich the nutrient-poor water, where rising water temperatures due to climate change are posing a significant threat to the future of the species. In the long term, the woodland creation will help to connect wildlife corridors along the river network and across catchments, such as Glen Feshie to the west.

These structures are proven to have an immediate benefit, helping to produce ideal conditions for salmon to lay their eggs, providing shelter from predators, and a source of food for the young fish by boosting invertebrate numbers. The addition of large numbers of big tree-root structures will dampen the river’s destructive energy during major flooding events.

2139,Monitor juvenile salmon populations in Caithness rivers,"CDSFB conducts an electric-fishing programme on an annual basis. The Board’s current data series extends back to 2013. There are six rivers in the Caithness District area which (1) differ from one another in characteristic ways, (2) are subject to different mixes of pressures and (3) are managed independently. Therefore, a strategic approach is necessary to obtain the most effective survey coverage while staying within the limits of the resources available to the Board. The strategy has been to survey a core set of sites every year to provide a continuous time series for each river and to add new survey sites or re-visit previous ones in order to address issues as they arise. This approach has proved informative for (1) understanding the ways in which salmon populations vary among and within rivers, (2) tracking trends for individual sites and (3) providing advice to river managers on a range of issues. In recent years, Marine Scotland has conducted the National Electrofishing Programme for Scotland (NEPS) which prepares regional assessments at the District Board level for fry and parr. However, a blanket assessments for a District including multiple rivers risks missing local factors which might place the performance of individual rivers above or below the District average. This is currently the case in Caithness District where trends the neighbouring rivers Thurso and Forss are demonstrably divergent.

Mitigation of the coming effects of climate warming on stream temperature is an important current preoccupation of fishery managers everywhere. The Thurso is one of the rivers participating in the Scotland River Temperature Monitoring Network (SRTMN) run by Marine Scotland Science. A set of 11 temperature loggers has monitored water temperature throughout the catchment since the outset of the SRTMN programme in 2014. The Flow Country Rivers Trust has contributed by servicing and downloading the loggers twice annually over this time.

2141,Monitor discharge rates in Thurso and Wick Rivers,"Caithness District has suffered a series of summer droughts since 2018. This sequence may be a coincidence or it may presage a local shift towards drier summers caused by climate change. Low water has direct, adverse effects on fisheries and perhaps also on the number of adult fish that finally recruit as spawners. Low water conditions are often associated with high temperatures and the combination of these effects is likely to reduce water quality, particularly for high-nutrient streams in agricultural settings like the lower catchment of Wick River.

2148,Develop recovery plan for Forss River,"Until 2019, fry density in Forss River was high ,commonly exceeding 1.5/m2, but values rapidly declined thereafter and by 2022 fry densities were around only 0.01/m2. The change is mainly attributable to mortality of potential spawners due to RSD/ Saprolegnia although additional factors are also known to have been in play. Relatively low densities of very large 1+ parr were still present in 2022 but these fish will leave the river in 2023 and, thereafter, it is expected that only minimal population of juvenile salmon will remain in coming years. It is therefore intended to develop a recovery plan for Forss to be enacted before 2025 when the 2SW fish derived from the 2023 smolt run will return. There are two problems that need to be addressed to speed fish through the lower river in the expectation that this will reduce the incidence and severity of RSD/ Saprolegnia: these are at the river entrance and at Forss Falls. In addition, passage at Shurrery dam must be eased to bring the upper part of the river into full production. The problems at Shurrery were identified some time ago by CDSFB  and a solution is available. The engagement of SEPA (CAR License holder) and Scottish Water will be necessary to make progress.

2152,Removal of riparian conifer regen,On the upper river within the commercial plantations there is a significant issue with naturally seeded conifers along the banks of some watercourses.  This seems to be particularly bad on the upper catchment on areas cleared for peatland restoration at Tannylaggie (Dargoal Burn).  Riparian conifer regen will outcompete and replace native plant species. Also the excessive levels of shade produced all year round can reduce primary production in the watercourse and cause bank erosion due to the loss of protective vegetation layers.  Conifers can also contribute to acidification issues caused by the scavenging of pollutants.,Instream and Riparian Habitat,,Ongoing,High,To manage conifer regen alongside all water courses within plantations,G,On going surveys are required to map locations and densities of conifer regen around the key water courses of the upper Bladnoch and Tarf Water - often it is the smaller tributaries that are worse affected.

2158,Reduce pike predation on juvenile salmon (especially smolts) stocks,There is a large pike population across the River Bladnoch catchment.   These pike are major predators of juvenile salmon.  Salmon fry and parr are predated on in runs / riffles all year round especially during low flows by small jack pike (research suggests an optimal prey size is about 30% of a pike body length).  There is a particular concern that high numbers of smolts are being killed during dry prolonged springs.  In the past when more anglers were fishing the river then alot of jack pike would be removed from the sections of the river where pike predations is highest on juvenile salmon.  Research shows that the main impact will be from smaller jack pike with larger pike being in the slower deeper water and feeding on roach / perch and even other pike.  Electrofishing is not permitted to be used for pike culling.,Predation,,Ongoing,High,Reduce the predation of juvenile salmon by pike,J,"The BDSFB believe it is necessary to increase the culling of pike where they are predating on juvenile salmon due to salmon stocks being low.  A particular concern is predation of smolts which can be prolonged during dry springs.  Anglers are being asked to target the catching and culling of pike, especially jack pike.

2159,Stop the replanting of conifers on deep peats,"Extensive draining of deep peats (>50cm deep) to get conditions suitable to grow conifers will severly damage the peatland.  These damaged peatlands are causing acidification of surrounding rivers and burns in many poorly buffered upland areas of Galloway, including the Bladnoch and Tarf.  New forest plantings are not allowed to take place on deep peat due to the recognised environmental harm but the replanting of conifers can and does regularly take place on previously planted deep peats with only limited constraints.

2161,Monitor water quality (acidification) in the upper river,"The upper Bladnoch and Tarf are recognised as suffering from acidification from a combination of acid rain, poorly buffered underlying geology, damaged peatlands and extensive Sitka spruce afforestation.  Various works have been undertaken over the years to improve the situation - many are on-going - including forestry restructuring, removal of conifer regen, etc.  Studies are sugggesting that some limited pH improvement and fish stocks recovery has occurred but much more needs to be done to recover conditions back to pre-Sitka afforestation conditions.

2164,Understanding why marine return rates are presently so poor,"Scientific studies show that the overall return rates for salmon smolts going to sea is now very low.  As the survival of salmon in the marine environment is low then less adult fish are returning to rivers.  It has been suggested that possibly return rates are only a tenth of that recorded a few decades ago.  Many possible causes are suggested including by-catch from mackeral fisheries, increased predation, lack of food, pollution, aquaculture and netting.

2165,Stocking salmon to improve areas recovering from acidification,There are various pro's and con's associated with salmon hatchery programmes.  A targetted stocking programme following best practice with clear objectives can be a useful fishery management tool.  Acidification causes recruitment failure as salmon eggs are unable to hatch successfully and older fish struggle to survive in the elevated levels of toxic labile Aluminium which occurs in low pH conditions.  As pH levels recover then stocking can help to bring back salmon to areas they were lost from.,Other,,Ongoing,Medium,Get wild salmon to areas of the upper river where water quality has improved,R,Run a stocking programme following best practice.

2174,Removal of riparian conifer regen,"On the upper river within the commercial plantations there is a significant issue with naturally seeded conifers along the banks of watercourses.  This seems to be particularly bad on the poor soils of the upper catchment.  These trees are often growing more densly than planted planations.  These conifers will outcompete and replace native plant species. Also the excessive levels of shade produced all year round can reduce primary production in the watercourse and cause bank erosion due to the loss of protective vegetation layers.  Conifers can also contribute to acidification issues caused by the scavenging of pollutants.  In the upper river conifer regen is a concern along the Big Water of Fleet, Little Water of Fleet, Cleugh of Eglon*, Craiglowrie Burn*, Benmeal Burn*, Carrouch Burn and Lagg Burn (* shows burns which GFT cleared with contractors in 2021 under a NRF grant).  Most of the clearance work has been completed by GFT and FLS (who own all of the land and also have a budget for clearance work).

2175,Plant riparian native trees,"Although much of the lower and mid catchment benefits from good levels of native riparian woodland this is not the case for the upper river.  In the upper catchment it is either open moorland (Cairnsmore of Fleet Nature Reserve) or FLS owned conifer plantation - there are few riparian native hardwoods at these locations.  It is important to establish an extensive riparian native hardwood woodland, particularly on the south bank, to provide adequate levels of shade to help address predicted increasing water temperatures.  While increasing climate change resilience is the priority pressure to address, this tree planting will also improve habitats, input woody debris and protect banks from erosion.

Both of these INNS species are a concern as they are increasing in overall area.  These INNS species cause problems through outcompeting and replacing native vegetation and increased erosion risk when the INNS die back in the winter leaving banks unprotected.

2179,Reduce fine silt input to upper river,"On the Fleet small substrates, particularly sand and small gravel, are present in significant levels within the river channel in the upper and mid river.  These fine substrates are filling in the voids between larger substrates reducing the potential for spawning habitats and invertbrate habitats.  The mobile smaller substrates are also a concern as sediment bars are causing excessive bankside erosion in some places.  The problem originates from erosion of thin soils in the upper river, sometimes associated with forestry practice, road drainage and land slips.  There is a need to focus work on addressing the source of these fines - possible works include stabilising eroding banks, improving track drainage and the use of silt traps.",Instream and Riparian Habitat,,Planned,Medium,Reduce input of fine substrate through focussed action.

2180,Improve instream habitats,Instream habitat quality has a strong bearing on numbers of juvenile salmonids that a water course can support.  In the Fleet instream habitat quality is reasonable in most of the mid / lower catchment.  The main instream habitat component missing from the upper river catchment is woody debris.  Woody debris is an important habitat component of river systems and is required for a river to function naturally.  Woody debris helps to increase the climate change resilience of watercourses.

2181,Stop the replanting of conifers on deep peats,"Extensive draining of deep peats (>50cm deep) to get conditions suitable to grow conifers will severly damage the peatland.  These damaged peatlands are causing acidification of surrounding rivers and burns in many poorly buffered upland areas of Galloway, including the Water of Fleet.  New forest plantings are not allowed to take place on deep peat due to the recognised environmental harm but the replanting of conifers can and does regularly take place on previously planted deep peats with only limited constraints.

As the survival of salmon in the marine environment is low then less adult fish are returning to rivers.  It has been suggested that possibly return rates are only a tenth of that recorded a few decades ago.  Many possible causes are suggested including by-catch from mackeral fisheries, increased predation, lack of food, pollution, aquaculture and netting.

2212,Understanding why marine return rates are presently so poor,"Scientific studies show that the overall return rates for salmon smolts going to sea is now very low.  As the survival of salmon in the marine environment is low then less adult fish are returning to rivers.  It has been suggested that possibly return rates are only a tenth of that recorded a few decades ago.  Many possible causes are suggested including by-catch from mackeral fisheries, increased predation, lack of food, pollution, aquaculture and netting.  For the long term recovery of salmon stocks it is essential to understand the cause(s) of present poor marine survival rates.  This will require large scale research programmes led by suitable organisations.",Other,,Not Possible,High,Understanding properly the poor marine survival rates,P,Not a local management strategy,2,https://marine.gov.scot/sma/assessment/salmon-and-sea-trout,Unknown,Unknown,All relevent NGOs & Gos,0,0,No,0,Unfunded,More than 5 Years,Not local management action,282717,560333,,Not Possible,,,,,,Urr,FD41,MA1103,2cb84131-b83d-46d0-83aa-99c15d4b416c,Mix of Private & Public Funding,N/A,0,-3.831601346,54.92388814

2288,Improving Upstream Fish Passage at Spey Dam,"Spey Dam was constructed in 1942 in order to provide hydroelectric power to meet the demands of WW2. However, since it’s construction it has caused consistent environmental problems for the Spey and specifically, the population of Atlantic salmon. One of the major issues is that of upstream fish passage. Although a fish pass is present at Spey Dam, it is antiquated and ineffective. This is evident by the juvenile salmonid electrofishing surveys that the board have conducted over the decades as well as a study that estimates that only 29 fish successfully traversed the fish pass in 2015. As a result, it is of utmost importance to increase passability of Spey Dam to spawning salmonids.",Obstacles to Fish Passage,,Ongoing,High,To increase the density of juvenile salmonids above Spey Dam by increasing upstream passage of spawning adult fish,D,The following steps at Spey Dam are scheduled to improve upstream fish passage. 1) Install a lighting system within the fishpass to match external lighting conditions 2) Conduct a topographic survey of the fishpass to model improvements that can be made to reduce turbulence 3) Physically modify the notches of the fishpass to improve passage 4) Monitor improvements in fish passage through redd counts and electrofishing,1,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0Fz98sqe-eEu2sXaf9vYX7-MPRkGpha/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=114143616884149740140&rtpof=true&sd=true,"Topological survey of the fish pass, modelled best actions to improve passage, juvenile salmonid density upstream of Spey Dam",GFG,,200000,0,Yes,0,Funding Secured,Within 2 Years,"Working with old infrastructure without interferring with the Salmonid life cycle, current fish pass is too steep",258192,793542,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AO_LOCD5r1ck-nTZpX9NamkSvGN2s4tW/view?usp=share_link,,,,,,,Spey,FD35,MA0342,dea0a1e7-2b2f-402b-87d7-6689d7f8591e,Private Finance,Estimate,200000,-4.336926488,57.01123433

In Scotland, pink salmon have exhibited a strong odd year class since 2017 and significant pink salmon numbers have been sighted and captured biennially in the Kyle catchment.

2495,Identifying Fish Farm Escapes,"Escapees from fish farms can interact with the wild population in a number of ways. Escapees can breed directly with the wild population, and this introgression reduces the fitness of the wild population.

2496,Installing Efficient Smolt Traps on the Shin Tributaries,"To mitigate against the Shin Hydro Scheme, Kyle Fisheries and SSE annually trap and truck smolts from the Loch Shin tributaries to below the dam. To trap the smolts,  rotary screw traps are utilised which are designed to only sample a proportion of the population, not to capture the entirity of the run.

2498,Smolt Migration across Shin Hydro Scheme,"Smolts migrating from the upper tributaries of the Shin catchment e.g., the Tirry, Fiag and Merkland, are required to navigate through the Shin hydroelectric scheme situated at the base of Loch Shin. For nearly two decades, the Kyle has mitigated against the potential impact of the two dams on smolt migration by trapping and trucking.

2499,Implementing a Restoration Strategy for the River Merkland,"There are 3 smolt farms in operation in the upper Shin Catchments, one of which is located in Loch Merkland. Despite no escapes being formally reported from the site since 2000, smolts of farmed origin have been routinely caught in the rotary screw traps. The impact these escapes have on the wild salmon population of Merkland, if interbred,  is bound  to have a negaitve impact on the population but this has not yet been quanitifiable. As well as this, APEM conducted habitat surveys for the River Fiag, Tirry, and Merkland. The surveys for the Merkland concluded that there is a lack of spawning gravels for Atlantic salmon and that gravel augmentation along with the installation of Large Wooden Structures should be introduced to the river.",Instream and Riparian Habitat,,Planned,Medium,To create and restore salmonid spawning habitat on the River Merkland and restore viable salmon populations.,F,Establish the status of juvenile salmon populations and levels of introgression.

2908,Catch and release,"Throughout the angling season, potential spawning salmon, sea trout and brown trout can be caught and retained. This in turn reduces the number of adults reaching the spawning grounds and could, in poor years result in reduced numbers of eggs and resulting juveniles. The RDevDSFB operate a voluntary angling conservation code which is reviewed before the beginning of each new angling season. A copy of the updated voluntary code can be found online. The exploitation of salmon, sea trout and brown trout by rod and line occurs mainly on the Deveron main stem from the town of Banff (estuary) to the conclusion of Huntly fishing’s (Huntly). Very limited exploitation occurs on the upper Deveron above Huntly all year. Angling occurs on the middle and lower section of the Isla but effort is minimal. The practice of ‘catch and release’ has been increasing on the Deveron since 1994 and has been above 95% in recent years. In 2012 the Deveron Board adopted a full catch and release policy for sea trout and since 2015, more than 95% of sea trout have been released each year.",Other,Legal Exploitation,Ongoing,Medium,Increase the catch and release percentage,C,Recommend and advise the RDevDSFB on the implementation of their Fisheries Conservation Policy to maximise the number of adults spawning successfully and promote catch and release to anglers.,3,https://deveron.org/site/wp-content/uploads/DEVERON-ANGLING-CODE-FOR-SALMON-TROUT-2023.pdf,"Rod catch data, fish counter data, salmon conservastion assessment from MSS.",Deveron DSFB,"DBIRT ,AST, MD",0,0,No,0,Funding Secured,Annual,Lack of data on the proprtion of salmon that are caught multiple times.,369504,863400,,,,,,,,Deveron,FD13,MA0443,b6914812-bbd0-4255-a918-a76456c9b081,DSFB + Fishery Trust,N/A,0,-2.512722015,57.6595345

The coast is patrolled by boat and throughout the summer and DSFB bailiffs undertake land based patrols to identify if illeagl nets are deployed.,Illegal Exploitation,,Ongoing,Medium,Stop the use of illegal nets to catch salmon along the Deveron DSFB coastline.,E,Coastal patrols will be undertaken in conjunction with the Spey Fishery Board bailiffs to look for illegal nets along the coast.,2,,,Deveron DSFB,Spey DSFB,0,0,No,713,Funding Secured,Annual,Availability of Spey DSFB Patrol boat,380625,867490,,,,,,,,Deveron,FD13,MA0445,e00bfc43-89d7-4c70-9e4e-b8a87af646d3,Local DSFB,Very Confident,0,-2.326679731,57.69689004
2911,River poaching,Once salmon have returned from sea to the river they need to be protected to ensure that they survive to spawn in the Autumn.

2912,Fish counter,"The Trust has conducted extensive research into current fish counting technology and the most suitable options for the river Deveron. There are four types of counter technology available: Resistivity, Optical beam, Video and Hydroacoustic (Sonar). Hydroacoustic counters (Sonar) use sound wave technology to produce image data. We have completed two trials of the technology on the Deveron main stem at Eden and Montcoffer. The trials have been successful and demosntrated that sonar could operate best in high turbidity conditions. The technology also requires low engineering or structural requirements and produces high quality data. Unfortunately, the initial cost of the equipment can be high and management of the sonar equipment and post-processing of the data can be very labour intensive. Species validation of the counts (e.g. salmon or sea trout) is also not always possible under high turbidity conditions, so a local model would need to be developed to assist this important part of the data analysis. In 2022 MSS bought an Aris sonar to be used to count fish in the Deveron. This is currently going through the installation and trial process. The counter system to allow a more precise estimate of salmon and sea trout adults returning to the Deveron to spawn and inform national conservation models for salmon.  The model developed under the Conservation of Salmon (Scotland) Regulations 2016 to assess the conservation status of salmon in each river relies heavily on rod and line catch data. The model estimates the total salmon run from the rod catch and assesses whether that total run is adequate to meet the egg deposition target. Currently the model estimates that the Deveron exploitation rate (% of total run captured)  can be as high as 20% which is significantly higher than the estimate for neighbouring rivers. To fully understand the run and its relationship with the rod catch, a full river counter is required.",Multiple,"Marine survival, Angling exploitation",Initiated,High,Count salmon entering the river Deveron and estimate total run,L,"Trials were conducted on the lower Deveron in summer 2022 to find a suitable location for permanent installation of the acoustic camera, which requires an appropriate riverbed profile.

2913,Salmon survival,"To improve our understanding of predation pressures on smolts the DBIRT has been tracking smolts with acoustic tags from the headwaters to the mouth of the Deveron since 2016, working with the AST as part of the Moray Firth Tracking Project since 2019. This work has found that on good years (2021) up to 70% of tagged smolts will make it to Banff but in bad years (2018 and 2022) this can be less that 10%. Tracking of smolts in 2016, 2017 & 2019 showed losses of 0.5-0.77% per km but fairly uniform throughout the migration down the river. The exact cause of these losses is not fully understood but predation is thought to be a significant factor. If the observed mortality in tagged smolts reflects the natural mortality in untagged smolts then this reflects a significant loss at a key stage in their life cycle. It is important that as many smolts make it to sea as possible where they face significant further losses. The increasing predicament of marine mortality in post-smolts is arguably the most significant current problem affecting adult production and fishery performance today. There has been a decline in marine survival of salmon throughout much of the North Atlantic (NASCO State of North Atlantic Salmon Report) and monitoring by MSS suggests that the marine survival of smolts leaving the River North Esk has declined from an average of 40% in the 1960s to ~15% in the 1980s, to less than 10% in the 2000s and less than 5% more recently. These figures are representative of international declines in marine survival which translates to a direct effect on the number of returning adults to the River Deveron both to the fishery and spawning population. The main causes for this decline are understood to be changing ocean temperatures and circulation in the North Atlantic disrupting the food web on which the salmon relies. This has contributed to fewer adults returning to the River Deveron, and hence lower rod catches over the last 5 years.  Underlying long-term cycles of return timing may also be involved with different patterns being observed in Grilse and Multi Sea Winter Salmon.",Multiple,"Predation, water quality and quantity and Marine survival,",Ongoing,Medium,Monitor survival of salmon throughout different life stages,L,"A series of PIT (miniature passive integrated transponders) tag detecting arrays have been installed in the Allt Deveron in the Cabrach and at Avochie Estate. These arrays will detect any fish with a PIT tag and will allow us to monitor mortality of smolts on their downstream migration, subsequent survival at sea, and also to determine which individuals make it back as adults from their marine migration. The PIT tags used for this work have three significant advantages over the acoustic tags that we have previously used for smolt tagging: PIT tags do not have a battery which means they will work indefinitely; they are much smaller so can be inserted with minimal stress to the fish and they are far cheaper, so many more fish can be tagged. Up to 2000 salmon parr will be tagged each Autumn from the Allt Deveron and Blackwater and their progress downstream will then be logged on the Cabrach and Avochie arrays before they head to sea each spring. If and when they return after a year or more at sea, they will be logged again as they migrate upstream past the arrays to their spawning grounds. It will be possible to relate down-river and marine survival to size and condition of smolts. This information will allow us to optimise management actions in fresh water as measures to improve overall survival of salmon.",3,https://deveron.org/project-deveron/,,DBIRT,AST & MD,0,0,Yes,12000,Funding Secured,Annual,Measuring efficincy of PIT arrays,353278,846686,,,,,,,,Deveron,FD13,MA0448,9681489e-9f0e-4d54-b091-e88946bb089b,Mix of Private & Public Funding,Fairly Confident,10000,-2.781405046,57.50801975
2914,Piscivorous bird predation,"Avian predation has the potential to significantly reduce the number of smolts surviving to the reach the sea, particularly during periods of low water. It is well established the high number of smolts that Goosanders can eat (Armstrong et al 1998) and combined with the high numbers seen on the river in the spring there is a significant potential impact on the number of smolts surviving out of the river. Research conducted by the DBIRT has found that on average only 40% of salmon smolts from the upper Deveron catchment successfully make it to sea. Tracking of smolts in 2016, 2017 & 2019 showed losses of 0.5-0.77% per km. Even higher losses were observed during the 2018 smolt migration when the river experienced sustained low flows throughout the spring. The DBIRT is a member of the Moray Firth Sawbill Management group and annually gets a licence from NatureScot for shooting, as an aid to scaring, a limited number of Goosanders and Cormorants. To secure the licence the DBIRT has to conduct two annual bird counts according to a standardised methodology prescribed by SASA (Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture).

2915,Seal predation,"The predation of returning adult salmonids by seals can also be a problem on the lower Deveron and coastal area in terms of reducing the spawning stock available.  The RDevDSFB was a member of the Moray Firth Seal Management Plan (Butler 2004) and was annually issued with a licence for a designated marksman to shoot problem seals that had been identified as threatening the fish stocks within the Deveron DSFB area.  However, under the new licensing system the licence was declined by MSLOT in 2022.

Of particular concern is their impact on water vole (Arvicola amphibious) populations that are already threatened and on fish populations. The main threat they pose to fishery performance is the reduction in juvenile production through predation. The Deveron also has one of the largest breeding populations of water voles in Europe (Xavier Lambin et al, 1996 and subsequent works), to which mink also pose a threat to.

2917,Fish disease,"Ensuring that juvenile salmonids leaving the river and returning adults are in good health is of utmost importance to ensure maximum spawning potential. The DBIRT and RDevDSFB pay close attention to fish in the river and monitor for signs of disease or parasites. Anglers are asked via the Conservation Policy to report all fish with signs of disease or parasitic loading.

2918,Non native genetics,"The genetic structuring of the salmonid populations within the catchment is crucial to their long term survival and succes. To protect these populations, the DBIRT and RDevDSFB have adopted a precautionary Stocking Policy and a reporting scheme for escaped farmed fish that have the potential to spawn with wild Deveron stocks. Escapees from stocked inland fisheries or from commercial salmon farms at sea have the potential to breed with wild native fish and weaken the genetic integrity of Deveron salmonid populations. The Deveron is fortunate not to have salmon farms in the nearby coastal area but escapees have been recorded by anglers in the past. In the Conservation Code anglers are asked to retain any farmed salmon and inform the RDevDSFB. Rainbow trout farms within the catchment are monitored to ensure they have provisions in place to minimise the risk of escapees.",Aquaculture,Disease,Ongoing,Medium,Maintain the genetic integrity of the Deveron fish populations and sub populations.,C,Raise awareness in anglers to ensure thjat fish of fish farm origin are corectly identified and killed.

2919,INNS plants in the catchment,"DBIRT has been controlling INNS of plant in the Deveron catchment since 2005 but since 2018 control has been delivered through the SISI Project using dedicated staff, volunteers and commercial contractors. Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) within the Deveron district is a concern to the RDevDSFB & DBIRT.  If allowed to establish further, it poses the threat of shading out native plants by producing a dense canopy of leaves early in the growing season which can accelerate bank erosion. Knotweed also offers a poor habitat for native insects, birds and mammals. Survey and eradication is ongoing through the SISI Project and more information is available on the DBIRT website. Japanese knotweed is currently all female and cannot breed and only spread asexually. However, if it was to hybridise with Giant knotweed or Himalayan knotweed it could potentially begin to breed and the risk of spreading becoming significantly worse. 

Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) is distributed widely throughout the Deveron, Bogie and Isla catchments. Giant hogweed dominates vegetation in marginal habitats and along rivers, thus crowding out native plants and leaving river banks open to erosion. Sap from the plant can also cause serious burns to exposed skin. In 2005 the DBIRT began a control programme on the River Isla for Giant hogweed which proved successful and was then expanded in 2008 to the River Bogie and Deveron main stem. It has been the focus of work every year since through subsequent INNS Projects and many miles have been treated along the Deveron annually. Many landowners now take responsibility to treat it on their own land and the DBIRT will continue to support and encourage landowners to do so. 

Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) has become increasingly widely distributed throughout the Deveron catchment, with the most significant increase observed throughout the lower Deveron fishing beats.

2921,Pink salmon,"Following introductions into some Russian rivers in the 1960s, Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), a Pacific Salmon species, have slowly spread west and colonised some northern Norway Rivers. In 2017 unprecedented numbers were recorded in Scottish Rivers including two caught in the River Deveron. Pink salmon spawn in the summer and have a distinct 2 year breeding cycle meaning they are either of odd or even year populations. The Norwegian populations are odd year spawners and resulted in more pink salmon in 2019 and 2021. There is some recent evidence they could establish breeding populations in Scottish rivers but it is unclear how functional these populations will be. The risks they pose through competition and disease to wild Atlantic salmon is not fully understood but as an INNS, all anglers are asked to kill and report all Pink Salmon caught. Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, Pink salmon of the species Oncorhynchus gorbuscha are an

invasive non-native species. The 1981 Act makes it an offence to fish for and retain Pink salmon (i.e. have 2 one in your possession or under your control). However, if a pink salmon is caught accidentally whilst fishing for other species, although it is technically an offence, a defence of due diligence may be established if it can be shown that best practice was followed.

2922,Water quality monitoring,"To survive and flourish, fish stocks and especially salmonids require water relatively neutral in pH without excessive acidity, well oxygenated, without oxygen depletion from organic matter pollution (effluents) or from eutrophication impacts via nutrient enrichment. They should also have low exposure to emerging organic compounds (pesticides and pharmaceutical) and other new threats such as plastic fragments. A water monitoring project with the JHI detected 9 pesticides in the River Deveron in 2018-2020. Overall, the individual or total concentrations of monitored pesticide were within EU permitted concentration values.

2923,Invertebrate life,"Aquatic invertebrates form the base of the aquatic food chain, providing food for salmonids and also require high quality clean water and are very sensitive, even to minor changes in water quality. As such they are great indicators of water quality and ecosystem health. A number of key river shingle invertebrate species, plus a British endemic stonefly the Northern February red (Brachyptera putata), occur in the Deveron catchment, all of which are listed as ‘Priority’ species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. A number of issues have been identified facing these species, such as acidification in headwaters, agricultural pollution, sedimentation, dredging of gravels, deepening of watercourses and water abstraction. It is clear many of these issues are relevant in the river Deveron catchment context.

2924,Forestry acidification,"Acidification can result from coniferous tree plantations that collect and concentrate atmospheric pollutants which are then washed into the water course. The trees also actively remove calcium and magnesium which are natural buffering agents. Acidic conditions where the pH falls below 5.5 can increase the leaching of aluminium from soils and underlying geology which can be toxic to salmonids. Salmonid eggs are particularly vulnerable to acidic conditions as it can impede the function of the hatching enzyme. As juveniles get older they are more resilient to acidic conditions.

2928,Freshwater pearl mussel,Freshwater pearl mussels are critically endangered and as filter feeders are particularily sensitive to poor water quality. They have been defined as functionally extinct in the Deveron but there are recent local discoveries that suggest there might be remnant populations. It is important to determine if there are remnant populations and to investigate the feasibility of re-establishing a viable freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) population.

2929,Abstraction,"Water abstraction for distilleries, agricultural irrigation, trout farms/fisheries and human drinking water is common practice in the area and, cumulatively, has an impact on natural flow patterns of watercourses. During periods of low summer flows all the abstractions potentially reduce the quality of juvenile fish habitat and limit upstream migrating adults and downstream migrating juveniles.  Some abstraction points may also have insufficient screens to prevent smolts / parr passing through, which can cause mortalities, this is currently under investigation by the RDevDSFB.  The SEPA RBMP water classification online hub map tool highlights the King Edward Burn, The Turriff Burn and the Crooksmill as being Moderate for water flows and levels while the rest of the catchment is classified as High or Good.  The DBIRT commissioned a report in 2014 to investigate the Impacts of water abstraction on juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Deveron catchment which highlighted that natural droughts water abstraction contributed to an exceedance of low flow conditions with potential impacts for salmonid upstream migration. Consequently, the results pointed to further factors such as extreme climatic conditions and poor habitat quality, potentially caused by land use in the upper region of the Deveron catchment, which should be further investigated.",Water Quantity,,Planned,Low,To reduce licensed and unlincesed abstraction from the Deveron,L,Commission an audit of abstraction licences and registrations with SEPA to assess impact across the ctcahment.

2931,Water temperature monitoring,"Salmonids need cool clean water to thrive but different stages of their life history have specific temperature tolerance thresholds. The incubation period for salmon and trout is 100 days at 5°C and 50 days at 10°C (otherwise described as 500 degree days). Although trout eggs can survive in temperatures of 0-13°C and salmon 0-16°C, the mortality and deformity increase rapidly in water temperatures above 12°C. Once at the Alevin stage they can survive temperatures up to 22°C. The ability for older trout and salmon to survive extreme temperatures depends upon the length of time they are exposed, the upper temperature and the acclimation period. The 1000-minute upper lethal temperature is 27°C for brown trout and 29.5°C for Atlantic salmon parr. The seven-day upper lethal temperature is 25°C for trout and 28°C for salmon parr. Although able to survive these high temperatures, in the long term they need cooler water to feed and grow. Brown trout can grow in water from 3.5-19.5°C with maximum growth at 13°C. Atlantic salmon can grow in water temperatures from 6-22.5°C with maximum growth at 15°C. At higher temperatures salmonids are more susceptible to pollutants and pathogens. 

Water temperature can also have more subtle impacts on life history and behaviour. Smolt age depends on growth which is partly dependent on the temperature regime.

2940,Riparian habitat,"The loss of natural riparian vegetation and woodland is a characteristic of many upper river catchments in the Moray Firth region. This was largely caused by the clearance of native woodland for grazing in the 19th century and has been maintained by grazing pressure by deer and sheep. Watercourses within the fisheries district that are devoid of livestock fencing have problems with areas of bank collapse, which has in turn increased in stream silt loading, resulting in riverine habitat becoming degraded. Both the Isla and Bogie rivers have soft, alluvial soil banks which are prone to chronic collapse where stock fencing is absent. The Bogie is a naturally meandering river which, along with increasing incidence of spates, exacerbates the erosion problem. Previous restoration has been facilitated by the DBIRT identifying problem areas and collaborating with farmers to include these areas in their funding applications. The DBIRT have also carried out bank revetment work on the Aultmore burn (Isla) using the log & Christmas tree technique to protect a 100 metre length of river bank from further erosion. Similar work was undertaken on the River Bogie on a 30 metre stretch. The DBIRT successfully applied to the Heritage Lottery Fund to install ‘Willow spilling’ on the Isla and Bogie rivers during 2007 to halt two areas of chronic bank collapse. Hard standing cattle watering’s were also installed where stock had caused bank collapse. Other catchments that could benefit from riparian fencing and planting have been identified.

2941,Barriers to migration,"Barriers in the river to fish migration can be caused by road culverts, weirs, bridge aprons or excessive natural large woody debris accumulations. Not only can they stop or delay adults in returning to their spawning streams but they can stop or delay downstream migrating juveniles and smolts and lead to pinch points where they are more vulnerable to predation. Some barriers although passable under the right conditions can become temperature barriers when water temperature limits the physical ability of the salmon to navigate the barrier.  In the Deveron fisheries district, nearly all man made barriers have been removed or eased in the last 15 years. All man made obstructions to migratory fish tend to be historical that were installed before existing regulations.  Any new developments will need to include provision for fish passage under WFD Rules and should consult with the RDevDSFB/DBIRT in their design.

2944,Offshore wind,"The Deveron is fortunate to not have many developments in the coastal and inshore area that are directly threatening salmon or sea trout. Without a large estuary, the smolts can leave the river and are straight into the sea. There are, however, three large offshore windfarm developments being built in the Moray Firth, the construction and installation phases of which have the potential to impact upon salmonid populations. These significant construction projects have the potential to negatively affect salmon and trout in various ways. Noise during construction from ships and piling could damage or scare salmon and trout away from normal migration routes or feeding grounds. The noise could also disrupt prey including sandeels. There has also been some concern that Electromagnetic Fields (EMF’s) from the seabed cables could affect salmonid navigation systems and disrupt their migration. However, tests done in the laboratory by Marine Scotland Science suggest that the levels of EMF to which the fish will be exposed will have no effect on their behaviour. Conversely, it has also been proposed that the windfarms will function as artificial reefs and provide additional habitat in the Moray Firth for sea trout and may reduce commercial trawling and dredging. However, these artificial reefs may also attract large predatory fish and mammals which could increase marine predation. These projects all have a commitment to undertake salmonid monitoring that is approved by the Moray Firth Regional Advisory Group (MFRAG) to satisfy Marine Scotland licensing conditions. The Beatrice windfarm funded a salmonid tracking study in 2016 (Newton et al 2017). The Moray East windfarm has committed significant funds towards the Atlantic Salmon Trust Moray Firth Tracking Project 2019.

2945,Marine Survival,"The increasing predicament of marine mortality in post-smolts is out-with the scope of this management plan but is arguably the most significant current problem affecting adult production and fishery performance today. There has been a decline in marine survival of salmon throughout much of the North Atlantic (NASCO State of North Atlantic Salmon Report) and monitoring by MSS suggests that the marine survival of smolts leaving the River North Esk has declined from an average of 40% in the 1960s to ~15% in the 1980s, to less than 10% in the 2000s and less than 5% more recently. These figures are representative of international declines in marine survival which translates to a direct effect on the number of returning adults to the River Deveron both to the fishery and spawning population. The main causes for this decline are understood to be changing ocean temperatures and circulation in the North Atlantic disrupting the food web on which the salmon relies. This has contributed to fewer adults returning to the River Deveron, and hence lower rod catches over the last 5 years.  Underlying long-term cycles of return timing may also be involved with different patterns being observed in Grilse and Multi Sea Winter Salmon.",Multiple,"Climate change, predation, illegal fishingmarine developments, pollution",Ongoing,Low,To reduce or mitigate for increasing marine mortality,D,Engage with and contribute to the Atlantic Salmon  Trust's Likely Suspects Framework and the Missing Salmon Alliance to help identify and reduce threats to salmon and sea trout at sea.

2947,Electrofishing,"The DBIRT has carried out an annual programme of electrofishing since 2002 to monitor juvenile stock abundance and distribution. This monitoring programme has allowed the DBIRT to manage the fisheries district in a more comprehensive and efficient way by using the electrofishing data to target management actions. The electrofishing programme has been instrumental in gauging the effectiveness of remedial works carried out by the RDevDSFB and DBIRT such as obstruction removal and Habitat restoration. In 2018, 2019 & 2021 the DBIRT undertook electrofishing surveys as part of the National Electrofishing Programme for Scotland (NEPS) (Malcolm et al. 2019) that will contribute to the  Conservation of Salmon (Scotland) Regulations assessment of the conservation status of salmon stocks.",Multiple,Monitor impacts of all pressures,Ongoing,High,Conduct annual strategic electrofishing surveys (NEPS or similar) throughout the catchment to monitor the extent and abundance of juvenile salmon and trout,L,Use backpack electrofishing equipment annually from July - September to assess salmonid populations throughout the catchment.

2948,Smolt Monitoring,Since 2014 the DBIRT has been monitoring the smolt production from the Allt Deveron and Blackwater catchments using two Rotary Screw Traps as part of the Dorenell windfarm Fishery Management Plan. These floating traps catch a sample of the downstream migrating smolts and using mark capture analysis can be used to estimate the total number of smolts produced upstream. This monitoring continued through 2022 and thereafter the smolt traps can potentially be deployed elsewhere in the catchment.

This allows DBIRT to assess the age structure of juvenile salmon and trout within the freshwater environment as well as how long returning adults have spent at sea. The adult salmon data is used to understand the stock structure of the Deveron salmon population and monitor the proportions of spring salmon, grilse and multi sea winter salmon. It is also important for understanding the trout stock and monitoring for the presence of any farmed salmon.

As the survival of salmon in the marine environment is low then less adult fish are returning to rivers.  It has been suggested that possibly return rates are only a tenth of that recorded a few decades ago.  Many possible causes are suggested including by-catch from mackeral fisheries, increased predation, lack of food, pollution, aquaculture and netting.

2994,Pacific Pink Salmon,"The Pacific pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) is native to Pacific waters. They were introduced to some Russian rivers in the Barent and White Sea areas between the 1960s and 1990s. They have spread westwards and colonised some northern Norwegian rivers. Small numbers have turned up in UK rivers for several decades, but 2017 saw by far the largest number of fish captured in a single year with 139 recorded across Scotland. Fish were observed spawning in the River Ness, with incubation box trials confirming that their eggs were viable. Pink salmon returned in lower numbers in 2019, increasing in 2021. Norwegian experience has shown that the initial years of colonisation were characterised by a slow increase in numbers returning, followed by a rapid escalation to the point where more pink salmon are now caught in Norway that Atlantics.

3052,Removal of riparian conifer regen,Within the commercial plantations there is a significant issue with naturally seeded conifers along the banks of some watercourses.  This seems to be particularly bad on the Black Water of Dee catchment.  Riparian conifer regen will outcompete and replace native plant species. Also the excessive levels of shade produced all year round can reduce primary production in the watercourse and cause bank erosion due to the loss of protective vegetation layers.  Conifers can also contribute to acidification issues caused by the scavenging of pollutants.,Instream and Riparian Habitat,,Ongoing,High,To manage conifer regen alongside all water courses within plantations,G,On going surveys are required to map locations and densities of conifer regen around the key water courses of the Black Water of Dee catchment - often it is the smaller tributaries that are worse affected.  These surveys can be undertaken on foot or using drones.   GFT/KDDSFB consider these riparian areas need to be surveyed/controlled on a rolling 5 year programme.  Conifer regen is controlled by cutting the tree below its lowest branch.  Small trees can be dealt with using hand tools but larger trees require chainsaw operators.

3071,Mingarry - South Uist,"Historic and ongoing issues impacting wild salmonids on the Horneray River (also known as the Mingarry), South Uist. 

The Horneray River is heavily impacted due to barriers and resulting loss of habitat linked to the hatchery operation of Hebridean Smolts Ltd. The river has two dams the lower of which feeds the water intake pipe for the hastchery. This lower one has a poorly designed, inoperable fish pass (the entrance is about 2ft above the level of the Loch). The second was built using tarpaulin and sandbags in order to help regulate water flows from Loch Snigiscleit. Over time the sandbags have burst and smothered what was once pristine spawning habitat downstream. It is important to note that aside from migratory salmonids other vunerable and protected species (Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) are being affected by the situation at Mingarry.

3089,Kick starting the salmon population in the restored River Garry,"Salmon were absent from the River Garry since the 1950s because of hydro water abstraction. A modest baseflow was reestablished in 2017 but it was not known whether this would be sufficient to allow adult salmon to successfully ascend a waterfall at Struan. A programme of stocking with eyed ova obtained from """"reconditioned"""" kelts from nearby tributaries was initiated to generate a run of returning adults to test out the falls.

Adult salmon may now be able to ascend up to the hydro intake dam, but it was not considered feasible to install a fish pass to allow them further. In order for salmon smolt production to be obtained from the once accessible area upstream, it was agreed that mitigation stocking of eyed salmon ova could be performed annually. Initially, this is based on ""reconditioned"" salmon kelt broodstock from other local tributaries, but ultimately may use local Glas Choire or Garry stock, if a large enough self-sustaining population establishes downstream.

3095,Ensure adequate flow for the migration of smolts and adult salmon in the River Ericht at Blairgowrie,"Flow is abstracted from the River Ericht at Blairgowrie to supply a hydro turbine and a fish farm. Prior to 2019, there were occasions during low flow periods when the flow in the 4.5 km stretch of the main River Ericht downstream of the abstraction point was particularly low as there was no licence restriction on the amount of water that could be abstracted under such conditions. A SEPA licence review in 2019 introduced a restriction on abstraction at low flows but only to Moderate Ecological Status standards. A further review to Good status was to take place in November 2019, but this has still to take place in spring 2023.

3113,Understanding salmon production in medium sized rivers,"Most salmon production in the Tay district takes place in medium to large rivers, whether in the mainstem Tay itself or medium sized rivers like the Isla and Earn. These habitats comprise the majority of habitat within Marine Scotland's river categorisation model. However, very little is known about juvenile salmon numbers and trends in such deeper rivers as they cannot be electrofished. A better understanding of salmon populations in such rivers is therefore needed to underpin better management of the overall salmon population and help avoid the risk of misclassification by the river grading model. Medium sized slower rivers, such as the Earn and Isla, may be sampled by fine meshed seine netting where the substrate allows.

At a time when salmon recruitment is low, minimising the effect of piscivorous birds whose populations are healthy and/or increasing is important for ensuring the continuation of salmon stocks. Salmon produce more than enough eggs to populate a section of a river as large numbers are expected to not survive to migrate to sea - this is called density dependent selection when an over abundance of young accounts for a high level of mortality. Migrating salmon smolts are much reduced in their density and selection is now independent of their number.

3152,Protect water quantity,"The climate is changing in such a way that low flows are becoming increasingly frequent - partially because of dryer springs and summer combined with warmer and wetter winters reducing the amount of snow cover that historically would have melted in the spring. Low flows are problematic as they do not provide the environmental cues fish require to migrate out of the river or move upstream as adults. It also acts to concentrate the fish in smaller areas which increases competition for food, space and resources and makes fish more susceptible to predation.

3155,Invasive non-native species,"Invasive non-native species (INNS) can have multiple direct or indirect impacts. American mink will prey on salmon as well as other bankside and aquatic animals affecting local biodiversity. Bankside Invasive plants such as giant hogweed, Japanese knoweed, Himalayan balsam, and American skunk cabbage can dominate an area and outcompete other species making access difficult and reducing biodiversity and habitat for native species and important pollinators. Furthermore, these plants can reduce the stability of riverbanks as their root structures are not as tangled and extensive as a natural spread of native plants. This can lead to bank collapse, loss of fish habitat, and increased sedimentation. In river invasive plants - particularly Ranunculus - trap sediments which can lead to smothering of redd sites or freshwater pearl mussels. Large mats of Ranunculus hinders angling and makes responsible landing of fish difficult where present. There is evidence that Ranunculus provides shelter for juvenile salmon, especially in the chalk streams of southern England although Scottish rivers should have adequate substrate and habitat complexity for juvenile fish without the need for Ranunculus.",Invasive Non-native Species,,Ongoing,Medium,"Control the spread of INNS, particularly in riparian areas.",O,"The Board will assist fishery owners in controlling invasive plants and American by providing access to training, chemicals and joint working with staff.

The River Dee Trust will also explore contract contol of INNS on the Urie 2023-26.  Biosecurity awareness will be promoted to help ensure Ranunculus is not spread by river users, particularly into the upper catchment. Previously mentioned actions, including working with land managers to reduce nutrient input into watercourses, improving public knowledge on septic tank maintenance and working with SEPA and Scottish Water to consider waste-water treatment measures will help reduce nutrient input in the lower catchment and limit Ranunculus spread in the longer term.

3156,Remove barriers to fish passage,"Unimpeded access for fish to move up or down river is essential for fish to complete their migrations, move from low to high quality habitat, respond to temperature or contamination threats, and reach spawning grounds. Removing barriers where possible, providing alternative access where removal is not possible increases connectivity within the catchment, provides access to more fish habitat, and reduces the threat of predation.

Salmon require different habitat characteristics for egg deposition, fry, and parr and these differnt habitats need to be close enough from one lifestage to find and move into the next. Natural tree fall into the Don would have been a regular occurance for thousands of years and would have had the effect of providing structural habitat, slowing the flow of water, and allowing river substrates to settle out of the water.

3161,Renaturalisation of river channels,"Over time, the river channel has been straightened or constrained where historically there would have been multiple and or meandering channels moving through the landscape. This has the effect of disconnecting the river from the flood plain and not allowing the energy of the flowing river to dissipate. Faster water removes important habitat and substrates  and can cause huge damage during high flow events - something that might be increasingly common with the changing climate.

Naturally seeded conifers along the banks of watercourses can be a concern outcompeting and replacing native plant species. Also the excessive levels of shade produced all year round can reduce primary production in the watercourse and cause bank erosion due to the loss of protective vegetation layers.,Instream and Riparian Habitat,,Ongoing,High,To manage conifer regen alongside all water courses within plantations,G,Surveys are required to map locations and densities of conifer regen around key water courses in afforested areas - often it is the smaller tributaries that are worse affected.  These surveys can be undertaken on foot or using drones.  Forestry ownership is dominsted FLS - need to check with FLS how much they survey.  We consider these riparian areas need to be surveyed/controlled on a rolling 5 year programme.  Conifer regen is controlled by cutting the tree below its lowest branch.

3227,Plant and maintain extensive riparian native woodlands,"The Marine Directorate river temperature monitoring network is showing that many rivers are at risk of becoming too warm to support healthy salmon populations.  Their modelling shows the Annan is at risk from reaching summer temperatures which would cause thermal stress to salmon and possibly death in the future..  Temperatures recorded already are near the lethal levels for juvenile salmon.                                                                                                                                                The ADSFB feel it is important to establish an extensive riparian native hardwood woodland, particularly on the south bank of water courses, to provide adequate levels of shade to help address predicted increasing water temperatures.  While increasing climate change resilience is the priority pressure to address, this tree planting will also improve habitats, water quality, input woody debris and protect banks from erosion.",Water Temperature,,Ongoing,High,To establish >30% native riparian tree cover on key watercourse banks through out catchment,Q,"The ADSFB consider that riparian planting must be undertaken at a scale large enough to make a significant difference across the catchment.

3228,Peatland restoration,There are limited areas of peatland in the Annan catchment.  Often peatland has been heavily drained in the past for conifer afforestation.

3229,Control and eradicate key plant INNS,"The Annan catchment has various INNS species of concern in riparian zones.  This includes Japanese knotweed, Skunk cabbage, Giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam.  These INNS species cause problems through outcompeting and replacing native vegetation and increased erosion risk when the INNS die back in the winter leaving banks unprotected.  Giant hogweed sap can also burn skin so there are health concerns too.  The ADSFB through the River Annan Trust ran a successful INNS programme from 2010 but it stopped in 2018 when staff numbers were cut.

3230,Stop the replanting of conifers on deep peats,Extensive draining of deep peats (>50cm deep) to get conditions suitable to grow conifers will severly damage the peatland.  These damaged peatlands are causing water quality issues where they occur.  New forest plantings are not allowed to take place on deep peat due to the recognised environmental harm but the replanting of conifers can and does regularly take place on previously planted deep peats with only limited constraints.  This is not a significant issue for the Annan catchment but is likely to be having some localised impacts where conifer plantations are present.,Water Quality,,Initiated,Low,Stop the replanting of any conifers on deep peats,I,"Annan DSFB will investigate where conifers are planted on deep peats within the catchment and ensure they (or GFT on their behalf) will input to any restructuring plans to stop replanting conifers or undertake ground preparation on these peats.

3231,Monitor health of fish stocks across the catchment,"Fish stocks (salmon) in the Annan have fallen in recent years and the River is presently a category 3.  A review of electrofishing data in 2022 found juvenile salmonid stocks are still relatively healthy but some parts of the catchment densities are lower than would be expected due to various potential pressures.  It is important to monitor fish stocks, both distribution and density, across the whole catchment for many reasons including directing /monitoring restoration actions, annual spawning success, on-going recovery or possible reductions in sub-catchment populations.

3233,Improve commercial forest design across the catchment,"The main areas of commercial conifer plantations is in the sub-catchments of the Kinnel Water and Water of Ae.  Much of this forestry was originally planted as 'old style' forestry which had few environmental considerations.  Restructuring of these forests (once the trees are felled after the first crop rotation) - since the implementation of the Forest and Water Guidelines came into force - has been important to increase buffer zones, reduce silt pollution etc.  Forest plans are an important opportunity for GFT and DSFB's to comment and request changes to forest designs.

3234,Manage bird predation pressures within river,"With salmonid stocks low there is a concern that predation could be reducing the number of smolts leaving the river.  Piscivorous birds (goosanders & cormorants) are predators which there are concerns about and can be managed through scaring tactics and lethal control.  Bird counts are completed twice a year, organised by Annan DSFB.

3235,Understanding why marine return rates are presently so poor,"Scientific studies show that the overall return rates for salmon smolts going to sea is now very low.  As the survival of salmon in the marine environment is low then less adult fish are returning to rivers.  It has been suggested that possibly return rates are only a tenth of that recorded a few decades ago.  Many possible causes are suggested including by-catch from mackeral fisheries, increased predation, lack of food, pollution, aquaculture and netting.  For the long term recovery of salmon stocks it is essential to understand the cause(s) of present poor marine survival rates.  This will require large scale research programmes led by suitable organisations.",Other,,Not Possible,High,Understanding properly the poor marine survival rates,P,Not a local management strategy,2,https://marine.gov.scot/sma/assessment/salmon-and-sea-trout,Unknown,Unknown,All relevent NGOs & Gos,0,0,No,0,Unfunded,More than 5 Years,Not local management action,319000,564400,,Not Possible,,,,,,Annan,FD01,MA1084,cb4aac9a-9d98-4c81-abc7-165e22ec0510,Unidentified,N/A,,-3.266781022,54.96763875
3236,Ensuring water abstractions are not harmful to salmon populations,There are various water abstractions present from across the catchment which could both inpact on adult salmon migrating up the river and smolts migrating downstream during periods of low flows.

3237,Minimise potential threats from renewable energy projects,"In recent years a number of windfarms have been constructed in the catchment.  A number of other wind farm developments are consented or likely to be submitted for planning in the near future.  Windfarms, especially during their construction phase, can impact on salmon through fish kills, damaging habitats and loss of food resource.  Silt pollution is a common and worrying problem.

3245,Address damaging bank erosion,Bank erosion is a natural feature of rivers and important to create meanders and to provide spawning gravels.  In many cases though it can be excessive inputting large amounts of silt pollution which can damage instream habitats particularly spawning beds.  Significant bank erosion can also cause flooding issues and can be a danger to river users.  It is expected that bank erosion will become more excessive due to the climate change predictions of longer and greater flood events.
