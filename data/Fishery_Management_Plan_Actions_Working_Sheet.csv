2152,G,On going surveys are required to map locations and densities of conifer regen around the key water courses of the upper Bladnoch and Tarf Water - often it is the smaller tributaries that are worse affected.  These surveys can be undertaken on foot or using drones.  Forestry ownership is a mix of privaye and FLS.  GFT/BDSFB consider these riparian areas need to be surveyed/controlled on a rolling 5 year programme.  Conifer regen is controlled by cutting the tree below its lowest branch.  Small trees can be dealt with using hand tools but larger trees require chainsaw operators.  Where conifer regen is found to be excessive then it will be controlled by contractors and/or GFT staff (assisted by volunteers where appropriate).,3,FLS and GFT hold various data sets from conifer regen surveys.

These arrays will detect any fish with a PIT tag and will allow us to monitor mortality of smolts on their downstream migration, subsequent survival at sea, and also to determine which individuals make it back as adults from their marine migration. The PIT tags used for this work have three significant advantages over the acoustic tags that we have previously used for smolt tagging: PIT tags do not have a battery which means they will work indefinitely; they are much smaller so can be inserted with minimal stress to the fish and they are far cheaper, so many more fish can be tagged. Up to 2000 salmon parr will be tagged each Autumn from the Allt Deveron and Blackwater and their progress downstream will then be logged on the Cabrach and Avochie arrays before they head to sea each spring. If and when they return after a year or more at sea, they will be logged again as they migrate upstream past the arrays to their spawning grounds. It will be possible to relate down-river and marine survival to size and condition of smolts.
